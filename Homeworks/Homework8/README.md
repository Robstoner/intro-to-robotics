## Homework 8 - Menu on a 16x2 LCD

The goal of this homework was to create a working menu with multiple options on a 16x2 LCD.
It is a continuation of Homework 7 and the game on the 8x8 matrix.

Here it is working:

### Objectives:

- Use the 16x2 LCD
- Work with the constraints of a small screen
- Make the game more user friendly
- Create a more complex project using the Arduino
- Get used to better coding practices and style

### Materials:

- Arduino UNO
- 1 8x8 matrix
- 1 MAX7219 driver
- 1 joystick
- 1 RGB LED
- 1 16x2 LCD
- 1 potentiometer
- 1 breadboard
- wires

### Code and difficulties:

This homework was a bit annoying to make because the backlight of my LCD was broken, and I could barely see anything on it.
I also had no great ideas for how to make the menu, so it took me quite a while to figure it out. 
In the end, I think I chose a decent option, and I'm happy enough with the result even though it's not finished.
