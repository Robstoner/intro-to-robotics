## Homework 7 - Game on an 8x8 matrix

This homework asked us to make a game on an 8x8 matrix using the Arduino and a joystick.

I decided to make a game with multiple rooms, obstacles and hidden treasures. 
The goal is to find all the treasures in the least amount of time possible, or to run out of shovels on the way.
The RGB LED shows the proximity of a treasure, and the joystick is used to move around the map and dig up treasures.

Here it is working:
